#Fortress
Remember one password, securely manage the rest.  Fortress is insanely secure and automatically synced between devices.

##Status
Just started building this project.

##Project goals
I decided to write my own password manager.  I wanted a password manager that I could trust, with automatic sync, and an easy to use UI.  KeePass, my usual choice, doesn't offer automatic sync and its UI is a little rough around the edges.  Things like LastPass have a notortious history.  So I'm building my own.

* Automatic sync - Easy to use across devices and easy backups.
* Strong security
* Written in Rust - Less bugs, cleaner code.
* Simple design - I opt for simplicity over performance; easier to audit the code and design.
* Trustless - The code is open source.  Data sync is end-to-end encrypted.
